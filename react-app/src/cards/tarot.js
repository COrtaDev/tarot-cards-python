But this doesn't seem to concern him - we are unsure whether he is just naive or simply unaware. The dog at his heels barks at him in warning, and if he does not become more aware of his surroundings soon, he may never see all the adventures that he dreams of encountering.",

The Fool is there to show that you can never really tell what lies ahead, and you can only greet it with joy.",

It can also be interpreted here that the magician symbolizes the ability to act as a go-between between the world above and the contemporary, human world.\n\nOn his table, the magician also wields all the suits of the tarot. This symbolizes the four elements being connected by this magician - the four elements being earth, water, air, and fire.

When you encounter her, you will see her sitting on a cubic stone between the two pillars at Solomon’s Temple, Jachin, and Boaz. Jachin (right) is generally referred to as the Pillar of Establishment and Boaz (left) is the Pillar of Strength. The pillars also depict the duality of nature; masculine and feminine, good and evil, negative and positive.\n\nThe High Priestess's location between the two suggests that it is her responsibility to serve as a mediator between the depths of the reality. She is the third pillar - the path between. She believes that both pillars are equal and there is knowledge to be learned in both worlds. You will also notice that she wears the crown of Isis which can mean that she is a believer of magic. The high priestess wearing of the solar cross denotes that she is connected to the season of the earth and the earth itself. The crescent moon at her feet is seen also in many depictions of the Virgin Mary, and means that she has a complete grasp over her emotion and the pomegranates refer to the ambition of the priestess.",

She represents someone that is intuitive, and beginning to open to her or his spirituality. Meditation, prayer and new spiritual work is indicated.\n\nThe card itself shows a night-time scene, meaning that the world in which she protects and guards is one that may at first seem frightening, but has the potential to lead us into the growth of the self. When she appears in a reading, she is calling to you to listen to her message, and follow her into your own depths. There is searching within yourself to be done for the answers that you seek.

Perhaps you aspire for a career that is more flexible than one that is governed by strict rules.\n\nLack of self-control and inability to handle situations can be represented by the Emperor on a personal level. When he is reversed, the structures, rules and systems that he creates are no longer working. His desire to inspire higher principles in his kingdom have turned to ruthlessness, tyranny and rigidity.

Instead of coming together with your different ideas, there may be competitiveness and a desire to just be right.\n\nThis card can also signal an overbearing partner, whether it's you or your other half. Be careful that you don't give up too much of your personal power, or repress who you are in order to be in this relationship. Alternatively, this card can also signal difficulty emotionally connecting in your relationship or potential relationships.",

If you’ve been lacking these qualities in the workplace, you may notice that it is taking a toll on your projects. Sometimes, this card can also suggest rigidity and bureaucracy in your work environment. This may stifle your sense of creativity and motivation, since the processes needed to do anything have been tedious and frustrating. At worst, the reversed Emperor can point towards a senior employee or boss that rules the workplace like a tyrant. Should this be your situation, it may be better to start looking for employment elsewhere. \n",

If the latter applies instead, you’ll really need to take a closer look at what you’re earning versus what you’re spending, and learn to cut things out.\n",

He is wearing three elaborate vestments which are designated to represent the three different worlds. His right hand is properly raised in an act of benediction, a sign of blessing – it’s the same hand that the Magician has raised. In his other hand, he carries a triple cross, which is associated traditionally with the pope. Each of the horizontal bars in the cross are thought to represent the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. Beneath him, two acolytes are seated, representing the transfer of sacred knowledge within institutions. Through these acolytes, the card also comes to represent following the path to knowledge and education.\n\nThis card is also known as the High Priest in certain decks - as well as the Pope.

This doesn’t have to refer exclusively to another person, but can also indicate a choice between love or work, love or family, love or friendship, or even sometimes love and your entire lifestyle. The idea here is that there may be a sacrifice that you must make in order to have this love.

The mountain denotes accomplishment, development, and success. The hermit tarot card refers to the level of spiritual knowledge that he attained, and that he is ready to impart that knowledge to everyone. There is also a deep commitment he has to his goal and a solid awareness of the path that he is taking. Inside the lantern, you will notice a star with 6 points which is also known as the Seal of Solomon. This symbol represents wisdom. The staff that he holds depicts authority and power.",
    "uprightKeywords": "self-reflection, introspection, contemplation, withdrawal, solitude, search for self",
    "uprightGeneralMeaning": "The Hermit is a seeker for the knowledge that comes from within. A lonely wanderer in the path of the night, he searches for that which can only be gained with long periods of solitude - the inner voice. To hear it, he must disconnect from the crowds whose voices and desires threaten to overcome his own. He walks through the dark night of his unconscious, guided only by the low light of the northern star, with his destination being his home, his self.\n\nYou are currently contemplating that you need to be alone. Never be afraid to take this chance to reflect, as it could help you clear your mind of all the clutter that comes with everyday life. The Hermit may also refer to your effort in taking action that is authentic and aligned with your true self. You are perhaps searching your inner soul for guidance on what is right, and where your next steps are to be.\n\nThe hermit's appearance in a reading can also denote the appearance of someone who will come to your life that will be your mentor.",

    "uprightLoveMeaning": "Love, being one of life’s greatest mysteries, can be a great teacher. It requires all of us to truly know ourselves, our needs, our fears and our insecurities. The Hermit tarot love meaning can signal that we may need some time alone in order to develop some insight about our selves before forming a strong romantic relationship with another person. This period may feel a bit lonely, but it will place you on the right path to finding a love that you are meant to have. If you’re already in a relationship, this soul-searching is something that the two of you may want to do together. Both of you may want to think about what you expect out of a relationship, and what may make you happier. The initial talks may be uncomfortable, but will prepare a strong foundation for tackling the future ahead.",
    "uprightCareerMeaning": "You may be spending some much needed time thinking about what you want out of your career right now. You may feel as though the path you are treading at the moment is not really working for you, and there can be the sense of not being fulfilled. Right now, you are trying to understand what kind of work would give you joy on all levels. If you’ve been pursuing a career purely for money, or financial stability, these qualifications are no longer enough for you. You may be looking for a purpose, or at least something that gets you closer to who you want to be.",

    "reversedGeneralMeaning": "When reversed, you are perhaps in a situation where you'd like to be alone; there is nothing wrong about that. However, there is a possibility that your seclusion may become harmful to both yourself and others. Though the Hermit sets forwards with noble intentions to search for his inner truth, his path inward may also be filled with great danger. Going inward may lead to madness and the abyss, for the unconscious is filled with images that he may not yet understand, lurking and waiting to lure you ever inside. Like a man that gets lost in his own dreams, the hermit may find himself stuck in a world of his own, alone, trapped, unreal. You must learn to balance your need for truth with connection to your fellow human.\n\nWhen it comes to work, the hermit reversal meaning refers to your preparedness to get to the bottom of something that has been troubling you for quite some time now. There is searching to be done, and it will be your responsibility to ask the question that will allow the other people to understand the circumstances.\n",

    "reversedLoveMeaning": "The reversed Hermit tarot love meaning can indicate a period of loneliness, one that is being forced on you instead of one that you are initiating yourself. While this time may be trying, making the most of it can help you concentrate on your own goals, and clarify what it is you want from a partner and from life. These will be the building blocks for creating a strong future relationship. Should you already be in a relationship, you may find that one of you feels distant and is drifting away. Someone may feel alone in the partnership, despite each person’s efforts. Now is the time to examine these dynamics and see whether you can extend a hand. Attention, care and a strong dose of self-awareness may be needed in order to feel connected again.",
    "reversedCareerMeaning": "At times, the reversed Hermit can signal coming out of a period of contemplation. You may be ready to rejoin society, this time with a clearer understanding of what it is you want in terms of your career. You may now need to do a bit of realignment, whether it’s looking for a new job, networking to find mentors and teammates, or other more socially related aspects of developing your career. On the other hand, it can also be that your period of solitude can be extending further; you may choose to avoid working with others altogether. Being on your own may feel much less limiting at first; but make sure you continue to receive social support. At times, this card can also indicate being forced to work alone, leading to feelings of loneliness, or being an outcast amongst your coworkers.",
    "reversedFinancesMeaning": "When it comes to financial decisions, you may be ready to look for advice from outside sources. Ideally you have come out of a period of contemplation on what material security and money means to you, and you may be putting those insights to use. Hopefully, this can lead to a better relationship with your material situation.",

At the center of the card, lies a giant wheel, covered in esoteric symbols. There are different creatures that surround the wheel; the angel, the eagle, the bull and the lion. They are related to four fixed signs in the zodiac - leo, taurus, scorpio and aquarius. These four animals are also representatives for the four evangelists in Christian traditions, which is perhaps the reason that they are all adorned with wings.\n\nThe books that each of the creatures hold represents the Torah which communicates wisdom and self-understanding. The snake indicates the act of descending into material world. On the wheel itself, rides a sphinx that sits at the top, and what appears to be either a devil, or Anubis himself arising at the bottom. These two Egyptian figures are representative of both the wisdom of the gods and kings (in the case of the sphinx) and the underworld (Anubis). They are rotating forever, in a cycle, and suggests that as one comes up, the other goes down.",

Perhaps in this turn of the wheel, the lesson is to learn to let go and release. There are things that cannot be moved by human will and action alone. When we do not let go, it can bring only more suffering, for you may blame yourself for actions that could not have altered the situation. When we learn to accept, we also learn to forgive ourselves.

In less stressful terms, it can be the coming of a new era, such as an engagement.\n\nIf you are not in a relationship, the Death tarot card love meaning can instead point to beliefs, attitudes or behaviors that you are currently shedding that can help you develop healthier, stronger relationships.",
    "uprightCareerMeaning": "If you’ve been considering a career change, the upright Death card can be a signal that you should take the plunge and act now. You may have been through a period of apathy, disinterest and frustration at your current job, and should you not take decisive action, events in life may force you to make a change. You may be clinging to your current path because it offers stability, certainty and safety, but if you are otherwise unhappy or feeling unchallenged, there is much more to lose than your comfort. Often when one door closes, another one opens; embrace the shifts occurring right now and dive in.",
    "uprightFinancesMeaning": "Loss is signaled by the Death tarot card, meaning that you may unfortunately be dealing with a loss in your financial resources. This period can also be the initiator to a transformation in how you handle your relationship to your money and what you value. The lessons you learn from this time can lead to practical changes when it comes to managing your resources, as well as to spiritual changes in knowing what is truly important to you.",
    "reversedKeywords": "fear of change, repeating negative patterns, resisting change, stagnancy, decay",
    "reversedGeneralMeaning": "The Death reversal meaning is still about change, but that you have been resisting it. You could be worried about letting go of the past, or you could not be sure of the changes that you need to make to go forward. Resisting the change and holding onto the past can limit your future, which can cause you to feel like you are in limbo. You should take some time to assess the ways that you have been approaching changes in your life. You may find you have been halting the changes that you need due to fears of the unknown. While you can still be afraid, you should trust that you are taking the right steps and move forward. Life moves on, so fighting passing time is only going to leave you with regrets. Death does not have to be a card of regret, especially if you heed its warning.\n",
    "reversedLoveKeywords": "resisting change in relationship, failure to change negative emotional patterns",
    "reversedCareerKeywords": "repeating negative patterns at work, remaining at unfulfilling job, lack of growth",
    "reversedFinancesKeywords": "failure to adapt to financial loss, continuing unhealthy financial habits",
    "reversedLoveMeaning": "The Death tarot card love meaning in reverse can signal strong resistance to change when it comes to your approach and attitude to relationships and romance. This can come in the form of hanging onto a relationship that is stagnant and no longer helping either of you grow as individuals. There may also be dependence on the relationship, or you may only remain together because you feel comfortable, obligated or scared of being alone.\n\nOn the other hand, old relationships can also be revived. If you are single, Death reversed in a love tarot reading can suggest that you must avoid negative  patterns and dynamics to be able to truly engage in a loving relationship. You may have self-esteem issues, savior complexes, or wounds that you need to heal in order to find a partner that will love and respect you, and one you can love and respect in return.",
    "reversedCareerMeaning": "As with this card’s upright version, you are being pushed to a change when it comes to your job or your career path. But in reverse, you may be doing all you can to resist this transition. You may stick around despite the unhealthy environment, the reduced pay, or the monotonous projects. Change is inevitable; this applies to our career as well as other aspects of our lives. We must learn to welcome it instead of pushing it away. When we cling to a cycle that is no longer meant to remain in our lives, we watch it slowly decay and drain us. At times, this card can also represent negative patterns repeating once again in your workplace. Do you self-sabotage? Does your defensiveness when making mistakes create trouble? Does your impostor syndrome affect how you interact with your colleagues? Consider what must be let go for you to release these unhealthy patterns. \n",
    "reversedFinancesMeaning": "A loss of financial resources may be unavoidable, but this may be hard for you to accept and adapt to. You may have to make some shifts when it comes to your expenses in order to make it through this temporary period, but you may find it hard to give up some things that you consider needs. Instead of allowing this time to change how you relate to your resources and what your values are, you may not be learning your lessons. Learn to stop resisting these changes, and you may have a much easier time coping.",

This card indicates that we must avoid going to extremes, and to be cautious and thoughtful of our actions. Consider your actions when it comes to love; and in what aspects your attitudes, beliefs or thoughts can be excessive. Are you too pushy with potential partners? Or instead, are you too reserved?

Or if you’ve purchased a home you can’t afford, and the mortgage payments are putting you underwater, it may be wiser for you to sell. Otherwise, one disaster is avoided, only to be restarted again next time; you may continue to have to struggle indefinitely.

Opening your heart to a more positive outlook can also open your eyes to opportunity.",

When we walk down the path, we walk the fine line between conscious and unconscious, between the tamed side of civilization of the dog, and the forces of nature represented by the wolf.\n\nThe towers on the opposing ends represent the forces of good and evil, and their similarity in appearance can allude to the difficulties that we face in distinguishing between them.",

    "description": "One of the most iconic images in the tarot, the Three of Swords displays a floating heart that is pierced by three swords. Above it, there are heavy clouds. There is also a heavy downpour in the background. The symbolism is pretty opaque, and the emotional effect that it has is immediate. The heart is the seat of warmth, affection and spirit, and the three swords indicate the power to harm, cause pain, and create suffering to what it pierces. This is an image of grief, loss and literally heartbreak. The clouds and rain depict the surrounding grimness of the situation. All these symbols point to the Three of Swords showing a low point in one's life.",
